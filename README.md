Task 4 – Sales Prediction using Python  
CodeAlpha Data Science Internship

 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting product sales based on advertising expenditure
using data science and machine learning techniques. The aim is to analyze how
different advertising platforms influence sales and to build a predictive model
that helps in making data-driven marketing decisions.
 Project Description
Sales prediction is an important business problem that helps organizations
optimize their marketing strategies and budget allocation. In this project,
an advertising dataset containing spending on TV, Radio, and Newspaper
platforms is analyzed.

The project involves data loading, data exploration, and visualization to
understand relationships between advertising channels and sales. After
preprocessing the data, a Linear Regression model is trained to predict sales
based on advertising spend. The model’s performance is evaluated using
standard regression metrics.

## 📂 Dataset
**Advertising.csv**

 Features:
- TV – Advertising budget spent on TV
- Radio – Advertising budget spent on Radio
- Newspaper – Advertising budget spent on Newspaper

Target:
- Sales – Product sales
Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
 Machine Learning Model
- Linear Regression

 Model Evaluation
The model is evaluated using:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R² Score
- 
 Conclusion
The analysis shows that TV and Radio advertising have a strong impact on sales,
while Newspaper advertising has a comparatively lower influence. This project
demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to real-world business
